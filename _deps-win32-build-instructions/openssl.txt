1. No need for tar (WinRar does the job / Symlink issues)

* ALSO YOU PROBABLY NEED TO MAKE A COPY OF MINGW32-MAKE.EXE -> make.exe
* You need Git-bash for perl.exe, sh.exe, etc. (Note: Install it somewhere without space in the path or you will get errors in configure stage)

2. Run the following for static builds:
perl Configure mingw no-shared no-asm --prefix=./dist

3. Run the following for shared builds:
perl Configure mingw shared no-asm --prefix=./dist

4.
// do not use -j5
mingw32-make depend
mingw32-make
mingw32-make install // probably fails, just copy the needed files

5. Copy the following files to an appropriate directory:
libcrypto.a
libssl.a
include/openssl/*
